## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-19

### Added
- Marketplace `nexus-plugins` with three plugins, each starting its MCP server from PyPI with `uvx`, pinned to an
  exact version, plus an English skill:
  - `nexus-android` 0.6.2: Android phone over plain ADB.
  - `nexus-windows` 0.9.3: Windows desktop apps in the background.
  - `nexus-browser` 2.10.0: the user's real Chrome in background tabs (needs the NexusBrowser extension and bridge).
- `test.ps1`: offline catalog checks; `-Full` starts every server from PyPI, lists its tools and fails if the
  server instructions or tool list name anyone (neutral texts since nexus-android 0.6.2, nexus-windows 0.9.3 and
  nexus-browser 2.10.0). CI on Windows.
